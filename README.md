# MisoAuto

A project to automate the content creation upload workflow.

## Development

1. Make sure you have `docker` installed on your machine.

2. Run `docker-compose build` in your terminal to build the Docker images for the app.

3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the app in development mode.

That's it! You should now be able to access the app at http://localhost:8000 for the backend and http://localhost:5173 for the frontend.
